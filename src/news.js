    Description: `When it was time for Lionel Messi to finally lift up the trophy that long eluded his celebrated career, in the centre of a stadium where one of the greatest World Cup Final matches was played, this coverage took centerstage. Again, one last time to mar a moment that finally crowned Messi a champion and affirmed that Qatar could not only deliver a quality World Cup – but perhaps one of the greatest tournaments in its ninety-two year history.`,

    Description: `On Wednesday, on a field in the middle of the Middle East and on the edge of history, Morocco will embody history for itself as the first African and Arab nation to make it to the World Cup semifinals since the tournament began in 1930. Morocco’s national soccer team will face off against France, defending champion and former colonial power.

      France is favored to win this match, but more importantly, a globe of people who see themselves in their players in between the boundaries of Africa and beyond the outstretched arms of the formerly colonized world will see a team announcing, fearlessly and faithfully, that we are not your inferiors.`,

    Description: `It was a spiritual scene inside the stadium at Education City, Qatar. Moroccan fans whistled incessantly when Spain took possession of the ball, then erupted with deafening roars when their Atlas Lions reclaimed it. Only the Sea of Gibraltar separates the European powerhouse from the African underdog, but the endless sea of Moroccan red in the stands and waves of prayer emanating from it confirmed this was a new kind of battleground.`,
