    Title: "UNDERSTANDING ISLAMOPHOBIA AND ITS MANY DIMENSIONS",
    FeaturedImage: "/news_bak_bg-1.jpg",
    Description: `Islamophobia in America is, in great part, a racial project. It is spawned by a master discourse that drove European supremacy and today powered by popular views and state policy seeking to safeguard its domestic progeny, white supremacy. The narrow racial framing of Muslim identity, deeply embedded in the American imagination, not only converges with the rising tide of anti-Muslim animus we now understand and know as ‘Islamophobia’ – but indeed, an integral part of it.

    Islamophobia is far more than merely “dread or hatred of Muslims,” or “fear or dislike” of the religion and its followers. These prevailing definitions tend to fixate on explicit or irrational animus, and far too often, the behaviors and actions of individuals. The role of the state, and its vast network of agencies and agents, is often removed from discussions of Islamophobia. However, the actions of the state and the state’s relationship to the actions of citizens, is vital to understanding Islamophobia.
    
    Islamophobia is also state law and policy. It is expressly found in its letter and hidden in facially neutral terms intended to discriminate, affixed with the state seals of approval that obliges the polity to adhere to the message that Muslim identity is presumptive of terror threat, and Islam a civilizational foil that must be confronted, or contorted in a form palatable to the state. Approaching a definition and framework for understanding Islamophobia, in all of its complexity, enables an appreciation of its numerous tentacles, and how these tentacles intersect with other forms of racism and bigotry, are extended by law and policy, and reach to color the perspectives of not only non-Muslims, but also Muslims, and everybody and anybody conditioned by the American Islamophobia that prevails today.
    
    This historical context, coupled with its modern complexity, inspired my new definition and framing of Islamophobia. Above all, Islamophobia is founded upon the presumption that Islam is inherently violent, alien, and unassimilable – driven by the belief that expressions of Muslim identity correlate with a propensity for terrorism. In addition to this foundational definition are three attendant dimensions: (1) private Islamophobia; (2) structural Islamophobia, and; (3) dialectical Islamophobia.
    
    First, private Islamophobia is the fear, suspicion, and violent targeting of Muslims by private actors. These actors could be individuals or institutions acting in a capacity not directed to the state. Craig Hick’s murder of the three Muslim America students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 2015 is a clear example of private Islamophobia, as are arsons on mosques or attacks on visible Muslims. Acts of private Islamophobia, oftentimes driven by caricatured understandings of Muslims and Islam, also menace non-Muslim individuals and institutions thought to be Muslim, such as South Asian Americans or Sikh temples.
    
    Structural Islamophobia, the second dimension, is the fear and suspicion of Muslims on the part of government institutions. This fear and suspicion are manifested and enforced through the enactment of and advancements of laws, policy, programming, or formal pronouncements by state agents. Laws like the US PATRIOT Act or Countering Violent Extremism, the vile anti-Muslim rhetoric of President Trump and the campaigns of state congressmen to pass anti-Sharia legislation distinctly and diversely illustrate structural Islamophobia. Structural Islamophobia has been openly extended by statesman on the Right, including Presidents George W. Bush and Trump, but also democrats like President Barrack Obama, who established counter-radicalization policing as his signature counterterror policy. Unlike private Islamophobia, structural Islamophobic policy and positions are just as often driven by rational motives as they are irrational, strategically deployed to carry forward specific domestic and international state objectives.
    
    Third, dialectical Islamophobia is the process by which structural Islamophobia shapes, reshapes and endorses views or attitudes about Islam and Muslim subjects. State action legitimizes prevailing misconceptions and misrepresentations of Islam and communicates these damaging ideas through state-sponsored policy, programming or rhetoric. Law is not merely policy, but also a set of messages and directives disseminated to broader society, instructing them to partake in the project of policing, punishing and extra-judicially prosecuting Muslims. We see this process functioning most vividly during times of crisis, such as the direct aftermath of a terror attack, when hate incidents and violence toward Muslims and perceived Muslims are pervasive.
    
    This definition enables an understanding of the epistemological and legal roots of American Islamophobia, and its ferocious rise during the past several decades. Just as critically, this framework enables analyses of Islamophobia as it interacts and converges with other systems of stigma and subordination, and indeed, the most ominous among them.
    
    Beyond its popular cover, Islamophobia is everything from law to Hollywood misrepresentations, violent assaults on conspicuous Muslims and innocent bystanders wrongly profiled as Muslims. Islamophobia is all of this, but also far more. It is, above all, a fluidly shifting and intricate system that cannot be reduced to mere “fear or dislike” of Islam and its followers, who occupy a range of distinct stations in society and experience it differently, and for the most vulnerable, disproportionately.
    
    Reckoning with Islamophobia requires situating it within the American context that feeds and foments it, which perils a broad population of could-be victims that manifest the multi-layered diversity of the country they strive to call home – against the collaborative efforts of the state and elements in society that fight to keep Muslims at the margins.

    Title: `Court Finally Rules What US Muslims Knew All Along: The ‘Terror Watchlist’ Is Unconstitutional`,

    Description: `There is no way to officially find out if you are on the watchlist [Getty]

 

    On 5 September, federal court Judge Anthony J. Trenga ruled that the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), popularly known as the “terror watchlist,” violated the constitutional rights of those individuals whose names appeared on it.
    
    Twenty-three Muslim American plaintiffs, who after enduring scrutiny and interrogation, suspected that their names appeared on the secret list, brought the case against the US government. The ruling was a major victory for them, and the thousands of Muslim citizens included on the watchlist.
    
    The government will appeal the decision against the watchlist, which the Terrorist Screening Center has used as a pool of possible terrorists to be placed on the restrictive “No Fly List.”
    
    In his 32 page opinion, Judge Trenga of the Virginia federal court expressed his serious concerns with the secretive nature of the watchlist, which is believed to include 1.2 million individuals and approximately 4,600 US citizens and permanent residents.
    
    The Terrorist Screening Center, an agency administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), does not disclose the names of those included on the watchlist, even when requested by those suspecting inclusion. This secretive structure leaves no opportunity to challenge or appeal inclusion on the list, which can lead to arrest or intense scrutiny at the border.
    
    And, because the FBI shares the watchlist with “more than 18,000 state, local, county, city, university and college, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies and approximately 533 private entities,” it causes considerable damage beyond the realm of travel and airports.
    
     
    
    Being included on the watchlist cracks open a Pandora’s box of personal and professional concerns, which can be as nefarious as driving surveillance within community mosques, or ruining a candidate’s chances at a job interview.
    
    The only tipoff indicating you could be on the list, is being called in for secondary questioning at the airport, or – as in the case of Anas Elhady, the named-plaintiff in the case – being surrounded by Border Patrol agents, arrested, and relentlessly interrogated for more than 10 hours.
    
    This stridence on the part of the state reveals what Elhady suspected, that his name appeared among the other 4,600 names of American citizens and residents on the watchlist. For scores of other Arab and Muslim travelers stopped and scrutinised, interrogated and humiliated, this serves as the only notice of inclusion.
    
    Thursday’s ruling may change that moving forward, and in the process, quell the culture of paranoia that has gripped Arab and Muslim Americans for years.
    
    It recognises that the FBI’s refusal to provide notice, and an opportunity to challenge inclusion in the watchlist, is a violation of due process.
    
    Judge Trenga observed that the state, “provides no notice concerning whether a person has been included or remains in the [watchlist], what criteria was applied in making that determination, or the evidence used to determine a person’s [watchlist] status.”
    
    The ruling opens the door to a range of possible remedies, including amending the process whereby individuals suspecting inclusion can file for disclosure, and challenge their inclusion.
    
    More ambitiously, the plaintiffs – and the Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the organisation that filed the case – may seek to entirely do away with the watchlist as it stands.
    
    Beyond process, Judge Trenga took serious issue with predictive design of the watchlist, which in practice, equates with racial and religious profiling.
    
    Unlike the narrower “no-fly list”, those persons included on the watchlist have committed no wrong, and are placed on it solely because of their religious or racial identity, country of origin, travel history, or other proxies that suggest racial and religious profiling on the part of the FBI.
    
    Indeed, another principal reason why the FBI is keen on suppressing disclosure of the names that appear on the watchlist is that it will reveal a pattern of religious and racial profiling, which opens the door for additional constitutional challenges being levied against it.
    
    While the decision will likely be appealed, it marks a watershed moment for the struggle against the crackdown on Arab and Muslim civil liberties.
    
    Beyond finding that the watchlist smacks against constitutional cornerstones of due process and transparency, Trenga’s ruling calls into question the problematic design of several other counterterrorism programs that punish Muslim citizens and residents under the pretext of terror suspicion.
    
    Programs like Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), whereby the FBI works closely with local law enforcement to prevent “Islamic extremism” and prevent terrorism, capitalise on the logic of prevention to monitor Muslims that have commit no wrong.
    
    For decades, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the FBI, and increasingly, local police departments, have been granted almost carte blanche and broad latitude within the realm of counterterrorism.
    
    As a result, the civil liberties of Muslims at travel ports, mosques and colleges, online and deep within their households, have been encroached upon and eroded.
    
    National security and terror prevention, in short, has been wielded more as a stick than a shield, causing considerable injury to innocuous and innocent people in the name of finding terrorists.
    
    This decision was a blow against the state-sponsored Islamophobia that has gone unchecked for far too long.
    
    And indeed, a victory for the very constitutional values that the War on Terror has ravaged for nearly two decades.`,
